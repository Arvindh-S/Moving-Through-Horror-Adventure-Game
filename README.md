# Moving-Through-Horror-Adventure-Game
## Introduction
This project aims to create the fundamentals of the adventure game with the help of PyCharm
IDE and with using the Python Programming Language. The text-based adventure game can
be of any type, such as text-based horror game, text-based Island wandering game and many
other types of adventure games that can be created for entertainment purposes. This game
was developed mainly with the help of PyCharm IDE and the Python programming language
because it provided lots of features to the game developers, allowing them to develop their
own game in very efficient and timely manner. The IDE features include a smart code editor,
which helps in the correction of code errors that the user makes and provides information on
the section where the error occurs. It also provides a smart navigation system, a fast and safe
type of refactoring system that assists the users in navigating, debugging and refactoring to
any part of the project and code with the safe rename. The features of the Python
programming language that helped in game development are it has a built-in library for the
game, which is known as Pygame, and it is easy to implement the coding.

## Problem Statement
The project’s problem statement refers to the detailed analysis of the issues or problem that
needs to be resolved. The major problems that are faced in the game’s development is the
writing and the execution of the code in the Python complier as the program is extensive and
very much complex. The game’s code is made up of multiple complex syntaxes and
statements which majorly results in the users mistake in writing the codes or when the user’s
indentation is wrong for the program, the entire code will have errors that prevent the game
from running properly. The other reasons will also include System failure, power outages and
software breakdowns which are encountered during the project that results in some small
issues which much be resolved and require additional time and effort for the project to be
completed. But in the overall scale, if one is careful and cautious when writing the program
for the game development that shouldn’t face any type of issues keeping the fact that they
know all the Python related concepts and implementing them properly to develop the game

## Objective of the game
In this adventure game making choices that helps the virtual character in escaping the
monster and escaping from his nightmare to save his life is the main objective of this game.
The places that the person goes includes from his room to the house’s hallway, where the
monster waits for him inside the doll so that it can attack and capture his body eventually
taking the person’s soul. The monster has called the virtual character by doing different types
of activities throughout the story. The provided file has been modified in the following ways:
the developed game is pasted into the text file, the text file is imported into the room python
file, and the room python file is imported into the play.py file.

## Conclusion
The game has been developed in such a way that the player or user can feel the adventure and
thrill when playing the game for entertainment purpose. The project is a basic text type-based
game in which the main job of the player is to choose the condition so that the horror story
continues and selecting different conditions leads to the development of different stories. The
development of the game is carried out in PyCharm IDE, and python programming language
was used to develop the entire code and the coding is done using the condition features and
navigation, which helps the user to complete the story. The conditions, if and else, importing
of the library and the python file are done in such a way that it helps to decrease the
complexity of the program and helps the user to understand the program.
